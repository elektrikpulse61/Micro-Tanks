# Micro-Tanks
An indie Java game inspired by "Tanks!" from the Wii Play game. Made using Greenfoot IDE.

I will release more versions of these during the summer months when I'm off from school than during the rest of the year.

Some things to consider:
  1. I made these for fun because I was bored one July afternoon after playing "Tanks!" on Wii Play.
  2. (off of 1) This is all in the name of fun. I do not plan on developing this into a "real" game on a store of some sort.
  3. I am open to suggestions and changes to the code. Contact me and I'll try to get back to you.
  
There are only a few levels, and there is only one game mode at the moment. This game is also quite buggy. I have a bug tracker on the GutHub project for this game. Please contact me to add reproducable (include instructions on how to recreate it) bugs to the bug tracker.

This was made using Greenfoot. If you want to edit the source code and test the projects (which I would totally recommend), you'll need to download the IDE at [https://www.greenfoot.org/download]. Feel free to contribute to the project. I will release "official" releases, but go ahead and add your own spin and feel free to update the project.
